<h1 class="title"> Here are my top 5 favourite songs! </h1>
        <p class="big-text-left"> In first place is Feather by Nujabes and Cise Star.</p>
            <p class="small-text-left"> This song has a lot of depth, pop culture references, and a freeing motif going throughout the whole track</p> 
        <!-- Add a 10-second clip of Feather by Nujabes and Cise Star -->  

        <p class="big-text-center"> The #2 song is Sing About Me I'm Dying of Thirst by Kendrick Lamar.</p>
            <p class="small-text-center"> This song has some absolutely stunning storytelling that makes you really think about it's meaning.</p>

        <p class="big-text-right">For the #3 spot, we have A Way of Life by Mosq.</p>
            <p class="small-text-right"> This is essentially a remix of a song from the game Persona 3. It has no deep meaning, but it's nice, upbeat, and calm.</p>

        <p class="big-text-center">For the fourth spot, we have White Beyond by Taisei Iwasaki.</p>
            <p class="small-text-center">This has a noir-jazz vibe that I legit cannot get enough of</p>

        <p class="big-text-left"> In the fifth spot is Fancy Clown, by MF Doom</p>
            <p class="small-text-left"> I like this song because of how open, honest, and angry he is about being cheated on and slandered. It takes strenght.</p> 
        <!-- Add a 10-second clip of Acordion by MF DOOM :3 -->
